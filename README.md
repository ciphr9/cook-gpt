Manifesto for Agile Software Development



We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br>
Working software over comprehensive documentation<br>
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br>
Responding to change over following a plan<br>

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
